# OptionInsight Bot – Technical MVP Document (v1.0)

## Overview
The OptionInsight MVP is a Python-based command-line tool designed to scan a list of stock tickers, retrieve historical and options data, apply key technical and options-related metrics, and output a ranked list of trade candidates based on configurable criteria. This version is built for easy customization and future expansion.

---

## Core Features

### 1. Ticker Scanning
- Configurable list of tickers (e.g., MARA, TLT, IWM) via `config.json` or CLI args
- Dynamic addition of new tickers or expiration dates without changing the code

### 2. Historical Stock Data
- Pulled using `yfinance`
- Includes daily Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume
- Used to compute technical indicators (e.g., RSI, Bollinger Bands)

### 3. Option Chain Retrieval
- Full option chain (calls and puts) pulled for each ticker
- Expiration is set via CLI or `config.json`
- Data includes bid, ask, implied volatility, and last traded price

### 4. Greeks Calculation
- Using Black-Scholes model:
  - Delta
  - Gamma
  - Theta
  - Vega
- Used to assess trade risk and reward potential

### 5. Technical Indicators
- RSI (14)
- Bollinger Bands (20-day MA + 2 std dev)
- Moving averages (future implementation)

### 6. Trade Scoring
- Each option is scored based on:
  - Delta range (reward potential)
  - Theta (time decay risk)
  - RSI trend
  - Bollinger Band proximity
  - Correlated asset alignment (stub logic)

### 7. Correlation Support (Stub for V1)
- Configurable asset correlation mapping (e.g., MARA → BTC)
- Placeholder for trend matching and future signal confirmation

### 8. CSV Report Generation
- Output includes:
  - Ticker, Option Symbol, Strike, Type, Expiration
  - Market Price, Theoretical Price, Mispricing
  - IV, Greeks (Delta, Theta, Vega)
  - RSI, Upper/Lower Bands
  - Trade Score
- Saves to `output/report.csv`
