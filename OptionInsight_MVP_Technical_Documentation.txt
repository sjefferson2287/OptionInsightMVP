# OptionInsight Bot – Technical MVP Document (v1.1)

## Overview
The OptionInsight MVP is a Python-based command-line tool designed to scan a list of stock tickers, retrieve historical and options data, apply key technical and options-related metrics, and output a ranked list of trade candidates based on configurable criteria. This version is built for easy customization and future expansion.

---

## Core Features

### 1. Ticker Scanning
- Configurable list of tickers (e.g., MARA, TLT, IWM) via `config.json` or CLI args
- Dynamic addition of new tickers or expiration dates without changing the code

### 2. Historical Stock Data
- Pulled using the Polygon.io API (`polygon-api-client` library).
- Includes daily Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume
- Used to compute technical indicators (e.g., RSI, Bollinger Bands)

### 3. Option Chain Retrieval
- Full option chain (calls and puts) pulled for each ticker
- Expiration is set via CLI or `config.json`
- Data includes bid, ask, implied volatility, and last traded price

### 4. Greeks Calculation
- Using Black-Scholes model:
  - Delta
  - Gamma
  - Theta
  - Vega
- Used to assess trade risk and reward potential

### 5. Technical Indicators
- RSI (14)
- Bollinger Bands (20-day MA + 2 std dev)
- Moving averages (future implementation)

### 6. Trade Scoring
- Each option is scored based on:
  - Delta range (reward potential)
  - Theta (time decay risk)
  - RSI trend
  - Bollinger Band proximity
  - Correlated asset alignment (stub logic)

### 7. Correlation Support (Stub for V1)
- Configurable asset correlation mapping (e.g., MARA → BTC)
- Placeholder for trend matching and future signal confirmation

### 8. CSV Report Generation
- Output includes:
  - Ticker, Option Symbol, Strike, Type, Expiration
  - Market Price, Theoretical Price, Mispricing
  - IV, Greeks (Delta, Theta, Vega)
  - RSI, Upper/Lower Bands
  - Trade Score
- Saves to `output/report.csv` (Note: filenames are now timestamped e.g., report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv)

### 9. Theoretical Price Calculation
- Calculated using the Black-Scholes model.

## Configuration (`config.json`)
```json
{
  "symbols": ["MARA", "TLT", "IWM"],
  "correlations": {
    "MARA": "BTC-USD",
    "TLT": "TNX",
    "IWM": "VIX"
  },
  "expiration": null,
  "max_days_to_expiry": 60,
  "lookback_days": 35,
  "filters": {
    "min_delta": 0.1,
    "max_theta": -0.5,
    "min_iv": 0.1,
    "min_open_interest": 5
  },
  "technical_filters": {
    "rsi_oversold": 40,
    "rsi_overbought": 60,
    "bb_break_lower": false,
    "bb_break_upper": false,
    "bb_tolerance": 0.01
  },
  "risk_free_rate": 0.03
}
```
*Note on `lookback_days`*: This has been updated to 35 from the original 30 to ensure a sufficient number of trading days are fetched for robust calculation of 20-day historical volatility, accommodating for weekends and holidays.*

### Configuration Details:

-   `"symbols"`: (list of strings) - List of stock tickers to process.
-   `"correlations"`: (object) - Mapping of a primary symbol to a correlated symbol (e.g., `"MARA": "BTC-USD"`). Used for future trend confirmation features.
-   `"expiration"`: (string, "YYYY-MM-DD") - The target options expiration date to fetch.
-   `"lookback_days"`: (integer) - Number of historical days to fetch for calculating technical indicators.
-   `"filters"`: (object) - Contains thresholds for filtering options contracts:
    -   `"min_delta"`: (float) - Minimum absolute delta.
    -   `"max_theta"`: (float) - Maximum (most negative) theta.
    -   `"min_iv"`: (float) - Minimum implied volatility.
-   `technical_filters`: (object, optional) - Contains thresholds for technical indicator-based signals:
    -   `"fib_tolerance"`: (float, default 0.02) - The tolerance (as a decimal, e.g., 0.02 for 2%) for considering the current price near a Fibonacci retracement level. This is used to set the `nearFib` flag in the output report, which can then be used for scoring.
